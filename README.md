## Project Overview

OrderMe is a mobile food ordering application tailored for Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) students, aiming to simplify the process of ordering food from local vendors who do not utilize mainstream delivery platforms. The app addresses the inconvenience of relying on manual WhatsApp-based transactions by providing a centralized and user-friendly platform that consolidates popular campus food vendors. 

With OrderMe, students can seamlessly browse menus, place orders, and make payments within the app, ensuring a more efficient and hassle-free food ordering experience. By bridging the gap between students and campus vendors, OrderMe enhances convenience while supporting local businesses within the university community.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
